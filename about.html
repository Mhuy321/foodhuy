            <h1 class="header">BAKERY:</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="thong tin">Baked goods have been around for thousands of years. The art of baking was developed
            early during the Roman Empire. It was highly famous art as Roman citizens loved baked goods and demanded
            them frequently for important occasions such as feasts and weddings. Because of the fame of the art of
            baking, around 300 BC, baking was introduced as an occupation and respectable profession for Romans. Bakers
            began to prepare bread at home in an oven, using mills to grind grain into flour for their breads. The
            demand for baked goods persisted, and the first bakers' guild was established in 168 BC in Rome. The desire
            for baked goods promoted baking throughout Europe and expanded into eastern parts of Asia. Bakers started
            baking bread and other goods at home and selling them on the streets.

            This trend became common, and soon, baked products were sold in streets of Rome, Germany, London, and more.
            A system of delivering baked goods to households arose as the demand increased significantly. This prompted
            bakers to establish places where people could purchase baked goods. The first open-air market for baked
            goods was established in Paris, and since then bakeries have become a common place to purchase delicious
            goods and to socialize. By the colonial era, bakeries were commonly viewed in this way.[2]

            On July 7, 1928, a bakery in Chillicothe, Missouri introduced sliced bread using the automatic bread-slicing
            machine, invented by Otto Frederick Rohwedder. While the bread initially failed to sell, due to its "sloppy"
            aesthetic, and the fact it went stale faster, it later became popular.[3] In World War II bread slicing
            machines were effectively banned, as the metal in them was required for wartime use. When they were
            requisitioned, creating 100 tons of metal alloy, the decision proved very unpopular with housewives.[4]

            World War II directly affected the bread industry in the UK. Baking schools closed during this time, so when
            the war ended there was a lack of skilled bakers. This resulted in new methods being developed to satisfy
            the world's desire for bread, including chemical additives, premixes and specialised machinery. Old methods
            of baking were almost completely eradicated when these new methods were introduced and the industry became
            industrialised. The old methods were seen as unnecessary and financially unsound. During this period there
            were not many traditional bakeries left.</div>
